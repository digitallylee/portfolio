    <h2 class="headers">About</h2>
    <p>First impressions take mere seconds and the critical decisions on choice of
      a product and services are usually determined by outstanding design. Time
      and time again, only the best design connects users intuitively and effectively
      to the advanced technologies that otherwise are complex and difficult to understand and use.</p>
    <p>The opportunities I have had are all transcending the connection between technology,
      human interaction & consumption, and application of concepts through UX design -
      with emphasis on trust, authentication, discovery and synthesis of user requirements
      and completely addressing user needs via physical and digital interfaces. </p>
    <p>The root of my motivations have stemmed from my own drive to develop long
      lasting relationships with my team and purposeful connections with personas
      from all walks of life. By emphasizing the importance of UX design, we can
      reach out to the right audiences like never before. </p>
    <h2 class="headers">When I'm not Designing...</h2>
    <p>When I am not designing multimedia interfaces I am using other forms of unconventional communication
      and expression. After graduating from Pacific Northwest Ballet School in 2017,
      I continue my dance training at Harvard Ballet Company, where I witness how
      creation and choreography can tell other fascinating narratives when words are
      not enough. It further inspires me to forge novel and creative pathways that
      can be applied in digital spaces, from the ground up.</p>
